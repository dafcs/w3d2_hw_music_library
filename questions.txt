"import psycopg2
 import psycopg2.extras as ext "
psycopg2 for python/sql relation, extras for cursor(?)

2.
sql = f'INSERT INTO albums (title,genre,artist) VALUES (%s,%s,%s) RETURNING *'
        # ^command    ^table   ^columns         ^to add    ^placeholder  ^return the row (for ID(?))
Why do we need to return *? would it not return when run_sql() is being called?

3.
def insert(artist):
    sql = 'INSERT INTO albums (name) VALUES (%s) RETURNING *'
    values = [artist.name]
    ...

4.
select_all() is not printing anything in to terminal.

1. why does this not work? below #

def delete(id):
    task = None
    sql = "DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = %s"
    value = [id]
    run_sql(sql,value)

######################
    sql = "SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = %s"
    value = [id]
    row = run_sql(sql,value)
    if row:
        return "deleted successfully"
    else:
        return row
