For next troubleshooting:
Are there , after each but last in create table?
Is there ; at the end of create table?
Is the %s being considered as a string because you used f''?
Is there a RETURNING * on insert/save/create?
When calling for run_sql result is the call being treated as a dict? because it returns a dict.
